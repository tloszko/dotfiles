# Find a location to save the script. Make sure the file will survive reboot. One option is to mount a usb.
# This gist provides instructions on using a usb for optware on tomato firware (which is really useful on its own): https://gist.github.com/dferg/833aade513965d78b43d

# Now scp this file to a desired location on your router. Its also possible to wget the raw version of this gist.
# scp ./adblock.hosts user@192.168.1.1:/mnt/sda1/dnsmasq/

# Give the script permissions to execute:
# chmod +x make-mega-adblock-hostsfile.sh

# Add the hosts file and extra configuration to tomato's dnsmasq config via Advanced -> DHCP/DNS -> DnsMasq Custom configuration
# addn-hosts=/opt/dnsmasq/final_blocklist.txt
# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
# domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.
# bogus-priv

# For debugging purposes, log each DNS query as it passes through dnsmasq. Remove this once you have confirmed it is working.
# log-queries
# log-facility=/opt/dnsmasq/adblocking.log
# This allows it to continue functioning without being blocked by syslog, and allows syslog to use dnsmasq for DNS queries without risking deadlock
# log-async

# Go to Administration -> Scheduler -> Custom (Sets the script to update itself. Choose your own schedule.)
# sh /opt/dnsmasq/make-mega-adblock-hostsfile.sh

# Add another custom command:
# service dnsmasq restart
# ~OR~
# Have the router reboot sometime after the script has been downloaded.
